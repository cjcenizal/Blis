/**
 * SimplestSpatialComponent simply stores a position.
 * 
 * In a more complex game, it might tie into Box2D, or provide some
 * game-specific spatial behavior (like for a tile based game where everything 
 * has to be in the tile map). It might just add a notion of velocity and a
 * per-frame callback to update the position.
 *
 * You could think of SimplestSpatialComponent as being a "model" from an MVC
 * perspective.
