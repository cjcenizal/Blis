Blis - AS3 BLitting Isometric System
======================

This system makes it easier to render and interact
with a large-ish number (~1000) of sprites in isometric
Flash games.

It utilizes blitting, and all rendering is done
using an isometric point of view.

Just a warning: this project probably won't be updated
until the Fall of 2012, due to the finite number
of hours in the day.
